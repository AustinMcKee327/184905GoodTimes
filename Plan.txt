Step 1: Add a Button, Label and TextBox to the .xaml
Step 2: In the Button Click event (.cs), declare a temporary string variable
Step 3: Take the Temporary Variable and use .TryParse to change the temporary variable into a string called Ottawa Time
Step 4: Take Ottawa Time and declare all other time variables using Ottawa - time = correct zone
Step 5: Take one of your Time Variables listed here(St. John's, Halifax, and Victoria) and create a new if statement where if 
Time variable is greater than 2400 you take Time variable and subtract 2400
Step 6: The if statement above works only on the timezones where it is ahead of Ottawa. You need three more if statements but 
instead of -2400, +2400
Step 7: If 60 minutes is input, it is an invalid time as you have 60 minutes which should convert to an hour. In order to fix this,
create an if statement for each time variable where you use modulus 100, and if the remainder is greater than 59, it will subtract 60
(the minutes that need to be converted) and add 100 (the correct output for an hour).
now add the code to the label to output "The time in ___ is... " as well as outputing the variable.ToString, and a new line with 
Environment.NewLine
